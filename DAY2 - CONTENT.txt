BITWISE OPERATORS:
     0's and 1's:
          some operation if you do like ths it will be faster like - compressing data.
          sending data in network to network.
          0-1 ON OFF or true false
  Different operators in this are: bitwise AND,bitwise OR,bitwise NOT(negation or 1's compliment),
        bitwise XOR,left shift,right shift

Condition/Contrrol statements :
  1.simple if :
         if (<condition-1>):
               statement-1
               statement-2
               statement-p
 Whenever we have a condition to be tested and we need to execute statement(s) 
based on a condition then we can use a simple if statement.
  2.if else :
        if(<condition-1>):
              statement-1
              statement-2
      else:
           statement-3
           statement-4
 Whenever we have a situation where we want to test a condition and if the condition is true 
we want to execute some statement(s) and when the condition is not true we want to execute another set of statements, we must use the if-else statement.
  3.else if :
       if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition.
  4.else if ladder :
       It is a conditional statement used for selection between multiple set of statements based on multiple test conditions. 
      The various test conditions are provided inside each if statement.
       if (condition):
            statement
      elif (condition):
           statement
      .
      .
     else:
          statement
  5.nested if :
        A nested if is an if statement that is the target of another if statement. 
        Nested if statements mean an if statement inside another if statement. 
        if(<condition-1>):
            if(<condition-2>):
                statement-1
                statement-2
