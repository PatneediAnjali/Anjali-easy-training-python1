DATA STRUCTURE
 helps to write efficient programs
Linear - Array/linkedlist/stack/queue/matrix
 1. static - array
2.dynamic - list,stack,queue
NonLinear - Binary tree/heap/hash table/graph
Linear - storing data sequentially
NonLinear - No sequential style required
Linked List :
 ex: train
As the name says list of items which are linked with one another is called as Linked List
Types: singly/doubly/circular

Creating a LinkedList
step 1 create the node
step 2 partition the node with two segments data and none
step 3 Add value into the blank node
step 4 mark the node as head
step 5 Create the next node by following the above steps
step 6 Establish link between first node and the second node

Displaying a LinkedList
Traversal is required from first node till tail node inorder to display existing linkedlist
